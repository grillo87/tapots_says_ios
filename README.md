<b>Tapots! Says</b>

<body>
<b>Demo App developed for iOS with Swift 4</b></br></br>

The app is based on my Android App, Tapots! Says, available on Google Play on:</br></br>

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.josegrillo.tapotssays">Google Play Link</a></br></br>

This is an example app developed for iOS based on the popular game Simon Say's.</br></br>

The app uses the following pods:</br></br>

- <a href="https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire">Alamofire</a></br>
- <a href="https://github.com/Otbivnoe/CodableAlamofire">CodableAlamofire</a></br>
- <a href="https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage">SDWebImage</a></br></br>

It was developed under the MVC architecture, it has a demo web service Top Players View on Apiary, it also has implemented Loading Dialog and Alert Dialog examples.</br>
The response for the web service example could be found at JSON Data folder. For serialization of JSON objects was used CodableAlamofire.</br>
For the quarter circles was used custom UIView.</br>
